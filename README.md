Student Result Management Dashboard
This project creates an interactive dashboard for users. The first page allows users to enter course details, including the course duration and associated fees.

In the student dashboard, users can input and store student information, such as the student’s name, roll number, and the course they are enrolled in. This information is securely stored within the system.

In the result section, there is a dropdown menu displaying the roll numbers of all the students whose information was previously entered in the student dashboard. Upon selecting a student’s roll number, their name and course details are automatically displayed on the screen. Users can then enter the marks obtained and the total marks for that student.

Finally, by accessing the view result section, users can see the detailed results of a student by entering their roll number. The system will display the course name, marks obtained, and the percentage achieved by the student.
